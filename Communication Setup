*What are your team's expectations about timeliness of replies? Immediately? Within the hour? By the end of the day?*
  Preferably asap, but within a 24 hour period is accceptable. Additionally, let the group know if you will be unavailable for long periods of time (more than two days).

*When should you use @channel to make an announcement on Slack?*
  When you would like to notify the entire group about something or have everyone respond to a question.

*When someone asks a question, who should reply? The "right" person or everyone?*
  If a specific person is @mentioned, they should reply in a timely manner (24 hours), but anyone is welcome to chime in.
