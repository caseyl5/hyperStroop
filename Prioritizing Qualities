Fun 

- First and foremost the game needs to be fun and enjoyable to the user. It's important to prioritize fun because if the game isn't fun nobody would ever play it.

Learnability

- The game also needs to be relatively easy to learn. If learning how to play the game is really difficult (especially for light flash games), users won't stick and keep coming back to play.

Portability/Accessibility

- Portability is important because the game needs to be accessible from different devices and places. We live in a world where there are many different types of people accessing technology in different ways; making our software accessible and portable is important to reach a widen audience.

Correctness

- The game actually needs to be right. There shouldn't be any errors in the actual design of the game and the game needs to actually achieve and follow the rules and guidelines we define.

Reliability

- The game shouldn't crash all the time and be readily available to those who wish to play it. The game should be very reliable because if someone wants to play the game and can't, it's likely that they won't come back.

User Efficiency

- The game shouldn't require a ton of user action to play. Because we're doing time challenges, it's important to have little user input to select certain answers etc.
