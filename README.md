INFO 461: Cooperative Software Design

Our Mission: hyperStroop exists to stimulate the mind. By facilitating interactions between peers and software we generate pathways to increase productivity.

In 2017, humans are bogged down by newfeeds that don't fully stimulate the human mind. Taking breaks is important, but what could we be doing to help the human mind foster its full potential? Here at the hyperStroop Group, we like doing things a little differently. We're here to design games that increase cognitive activity and take the user on a journey to another state of mind.
