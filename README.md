INFO 461: Cooperative Software Design

In 2017, humans are bogged down by newfeeds that don't fully stimulate the human mind. Taking breaks is important, but what could we be doing to help the human mind foster its full potential? Here at the hyperStroop Group, we like doing things a little differently. We're here to design games that increase cognitive thinking and take on you on a journey to another state of mind.
