INFO 461: Cooperative Software Design

*Our Mission:* hyperStroop exists to stimulate the mind. By facilitating interactions between peers and software we generate pathways to increase productivity.

In 2017, people are bogged down by newfeeds that don't fully stimulate the human mind. After a while, our brains numb out a bit to the constant stimulation, and we become unable to continuously treat the task as important. Taking a break allows us to come back to the job at hand with renewed energy and sense of purpose. No matter how much you love your work, you cannot keep creating when you are on empty. Recent studies (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110208131529.htm) have shown that taking breaks increases productivity, but what could we be doing to help the human mind foster its full potential? Here at the hyperStroop Group, we like doing things a little differently. We're here to design games that increase cognitive activity and take the user on a journey to another state of mind.
