# hyperStroop Group Process Specification

### Communication
* Facebook Messenger group for quick communication/questions between each team member. 
    * All members of the team have consistent mobile and desktop access to service
    * It has been the primary means of communication of the team so far and has produced rapid response times.
* Regularly updated wireframes on our team’s Google Drive to secure design consistency between views
    *Provides a visual check in for desired outcomes
    *Changes to documents can be automatically sent to entire team
* If we have questions for Andy and Benji, we will use Slack, but most of us do not check Slack regularly so we can get quicker answers via Facebook Messenger.
