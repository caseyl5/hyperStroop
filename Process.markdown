# hyperStroop Group Process Specification

### Communication
* Facebook Messenger group for quick communication/questions between each team member. 
    * All members of the team have consistent mobile and desktop access to service
    * It has been the primary means of communication of the team so far and has produced rapid response times.
* Regularly updated wireframes on our team’s Google Drive to secure design consistency between views
    * Provides a visual check in for desired outcomes
    * Changes to documents can be automatically sent to entire team
* If we have questions for Andy and Benji, we will use Slack, but most of us do not check Slack regularly so we can get quicker answers via Facebook Messenger. 

### Coordination and Planning
* Weekly meetings on Thursdays at 1:30pm in the Research Commons + Google Hangout for John to discuss:
    * What have you done (issues from the previous week)
    * Anything currently being worked on?
    * Current roadblocks (what you need and from who)
    * Where you would like to be by the next meeting (open new issues)
* Use GitHub’s Issue and Project features for issue tracking and project planning. 
    * Close issues assigned to you as you complete them.
    * Create new issues for the upcoming week at our weekly meeting
    * Drag completed issues in the Project column from ‘In Progress’ to ‘Completed’

### Progress Validation
* Issue tracking in GitHub
    * New branches for each issue on GitHub.
    * Low branch life, branches shouldn’t live for longer than a week without discussion; if you’re having trouble or are stuck, ask for help.
    * Pushing changes and commits on a frequent basis to measure progress.
* GitHub projects leveraged to track progress towards goal.
    * 3 Columns: To Do, In Progress, Done
        * Will input our issues into one of these columns.
        * GitHub will notify all team members when issues are completed.
* GitHub pushes commits on specific branches on specific channels on Slack
    * Team members will be assigned to appropriate channels to streamline the notifications and will not clog up the facebook messenger discussion.
* GitHub commits need to be commented and documented.
    * Note what was done and/or what is still left to do so you know where you left off and team members are aware of progress.
    * If closing an issue, describe what changes you made for the issue.
    * Note whether or not there may be dependencies that may be affected.

### Process Improvement
* 10 minute reflection/retrospective during our weekly group meetings.
    * What did you build? Explain how it works
    * Explain any problems you ran into to see if anyone has a solution that works well for them in the future.
    * How will what you built successfully interact with other aspects of the program?
    * If a flaw is found, share with entire group and discuss remediation strategies.
    * After the person is confident they’ve fixed the problem, that person should message the facebook group message and let people know what they changed. The rest of the team can then test it for bugs.
